# Loan Processor State Machine

## Overview

This example demonstrates how the toolkit can be used to test step functions. It shows how the toolkit can be used to execute and monitor step functions and how it can be used to exercise all the step function branches with the use of mock responses. In addition, it demonstrates how the toolkit can be used to observe DynamoDB table events along with SQS queues and SNS topics.
The state machine used is shown below.
