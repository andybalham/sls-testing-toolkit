# Serverless Testing Toolkit

A set of components that leverage the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) to make testing of serverless constructs in the cloud straightforward.

The best way to see what sls-testing-toolkit can do for you is to look at the example or, better still, run them.

> Note, this package is very much under development and details could change at any time.

## Examples

- [Simple Event Router](https://github.com/andybalham/sls-testing-toolkit/blob/main/examples/simple-event-router) - testing a construct that routes SNS events

- [Simple Message Router](https://github.com/andybalham/sls-testing-toolkit/blob/main/examples/simple-message-router) - testing a construct that routes SQS messages, complete with dead letter queues
